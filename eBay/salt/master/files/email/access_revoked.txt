<p>Hi <strong><em>{{ name }}</em></strong>,</p>

 <p>When the Linux Access Management Portal (LAMP) detects a device that isn't compliant, it immediately marks the device as non-compliant and you are
 notified via email. If the device remains non-compliant for more than 7 days, network access is revoked.
 These actions apply to devices that don't meet eBay's Information Security compliance policy.</p>

 <p>Your registered Linux device <strong><em>{{ description }}</em></strong>, with MAC Address <strong><em>{{ mac }}</em></strong> and Minion ID <strong><em>{{ minion_id }}</em></strong>,
 has remained non-compliant for <strong><em>{{ num_fails }}</em></strong> days, and so network access for this device has been revoked.
 To regain network access, you will need to re-register the device via the <a href="https://lamp.corp.ebay.com/">LAMP</a> web site.</p>
