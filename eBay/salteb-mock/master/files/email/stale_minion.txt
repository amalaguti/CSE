<p>Hi <strong><em>{{ stale_minion_data.name }}</em></strong>,</p>

<p>When the Linux Access Management Portal (LAMP) detects a device hasn't been able to be verified compliant in 7 days, it immediately marks the device 
as non-compliant and removes the MAC address from network access.</p>

<p>Your registered Linux device <strong><em>{{ stale_minion_data.description }}</em></strong>, with MAC Address <strong><em>{{ mac }} </em></strong>,
 has not been able to be reached for more then 7 days, and so network access for this device has been revoked.
 To regain network access, you will need to re-register the device via the <a href="https://lamp.corp.ebay.com/">LAMP</a> web site.</p>
